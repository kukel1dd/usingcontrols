This is a small project for my .NET framework class For week 3. We have learned about Events and controls.
In this program We ask the user to enter information on the first form and when the user clicks submit it displays what the user has typed or selected. 
On the second form there is a button. When clicked it will allow the user to select a picture from their computer to be displayed on the second form.
